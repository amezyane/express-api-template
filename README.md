## Main commands 

`yarn prestart`: Build the content of the src folder

`yarn start`: Start server from the build folder

`yarn startdev `: Start server in development mode

`yarn lint`: Shows linting issues found in JS files (see config in the file `.eslintrc.json`)

`yarn pretty`: Prettifies our code

`yarn postpretty`: Runs the `lint` command with the `--fix` flag appended. This flag tells ESLint to automatically fix common linting issues.
