## How to run the app

1. Clone the repo.
1. To install the dependencies, run the command `yarn` if Yarn is installed on your computer, or, `npm i`, at the root of the project.
1. Open a terminal in the project root and run `yarn startdev`.

## How to test

Run `yarn test`.

## Commands 

`yarn prestart`: Build the content of the src folder

`yarn start`: Start server from the build folder

`yarn startdev `: Start server in development mode

`yarn lint`: Shows linting issues found in JS files (see config in the file `.eslintrc.json`)

`yarn pretty`: Prettifies our code

`yarn postpretty`: Runs the `lint` command with the `--fix` flag appended. This flag tells ESLint to automatically fix common linting issues.

See `package.json` for the detailed command lines. 

## NPM packages

### Transpiling ES6 to ES5

`@babel/cli`: A required install for using `babel`. It allows the use of Babel from the terminal and is available as ./node_modules/.bin/babel.

`@babel/core`: Core Babel functionality

`@babel/node`: This works exactly like the Node.js CLI, with the added benefit of compiling with `babel` presets and plugins. This is required for use with nodemon.

`@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`: This helps to avoid duplication in the compiled output.

`@babel/preset-env`: A collection of plugins that are responsible for carrying out code transformations.

`@babel/register`: This compiles files on the fly and is specified as a requirement during tests.

`@babel/runtime`: This works in conjunction with `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`.

### Linting

`eslint`: TO DO

`eslint-config-airbnb-base`: TO DO

`eslint-plugin-import`: TO DO

`prettier`: TO DO

### Testing

`mocha`: test runner

`chai`: used to make assertions

`nyc`: collect test coverage report

`sinon-chai`: extends chaiâ€™s assertions

`supertest`: used to make HTTP calls to our API endpoints

`coveralls`: for uploading test coverage to coveralls.io

### Others 

`nodemon`: monitors our project source code and automatically restarts our server whenever it observes any changes.

`dotenv`: reads an .env file and gives access to the environment variables defined inside.
